This program computes a policy of movement for a 2d grid given by input.txt, which has a fixed set of unmoving obstacles and one destination location.The policy is a mapping that tells you, in each location, the direction you should go to achieve the highest accumulated reward over time with the greatest likelihood.Each movement has a 70% chance to be in the desired direction, and a 10% chance to move in any other cardinal direction.There is a small cost associated with each movement, a large cost for moving into a space with an obstacle, and a large benefit for reaching the destination.Input (input.txt):[grid size] (strictly positive integer)[number of obstacles] (non-negative)(next (number of obstacle) lines) [location of each obstacle] (in format x,y)[destination] (in format x,y)Output (output.txt):- obstacles are represented by 'o'- cardinal directions NESW  are represented by '^' '>' 'v' '<', respectively- destination is represented by '.'Example:input.txt:				output.txt4						ovvo2						vvvv0,0						>>.<3,0						>>^<2,2
